# Daily Competitive Programming Solutions (Codeforces)

This repository contains my daily solved **Codeforces** problems. I will be solving at least one problem each day and uploading my solutions here.

## Structure
- The repository is organized into folders, each containing solutions for one or more Codeforces problems.
- Inside each folder, you will find:
  - Solution files (in a relevant programming language like C++, Python, etc.).
  - A brief explanation or comments about the approach used in the solution (if applicable).

## How to Navigate
- Browse through the folders to view the solutions.
- Each folder will contain one or more solution files.
- The problem link to **Codeforces** can be found in the solution as a comment (optional).
